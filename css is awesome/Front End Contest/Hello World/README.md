Hello World


Welcome to the first Codavar front-end contest!

Introduction
In this part you are going to get familiar with the whole competition process. Also, there's a simple question at the end which you can jump into it, if you are familiar with the contest process.

Each problem starts with a short story, trying to give an idea about the problem. It's followed by a more detailed explanation about the project structure and the missing parts, which must be completed by you. There might be some images and GIFs, which show the desired interfaces or functionalities. Please read the explanation as carefully as you can, because the problem is broken down into small tasks which each part has its own score.

Your submission score is calculated by the sum of each task score. So if you are unable to complete all the tasks, don't worry, still you can get some points. The ranking is based on total score and in case of score equality, participants' total time is compared (lower time is better).

At the end of each problem, some important rules are described. Here are some important global rules which must be followed, otherwise your submission will be misjudged:

Do not change tag IDs (unless explicitly mentioned in the problem statement) because the judgment is mostly based on elements IDs
If you want to link to an external file, use relative addressing:

Don't src="/style.css" ❌

Do src="./style.css" or src="style.css" ✔️

The project file structure is shown as a tree view at the end, please be aware:

Your submission structure must be an exact match

Do not change name of a file, that is marked by *

You can name your zip file whatever you want
Your files must be placed in the root of the zip file (unless explicitly mentioned in the problem statement)
Most of the problems include an initial project structure file, which you can download and modify it as your solution.

Now lets start the competition with the HTML version of the good old (^_^) "Hello World" example:

Create an HTML file named index.html then:

Set page title to Hello World
Add an h1 tag which displays Hello from Codavar
Place your index.html in the root of the zip file:

filename.zip

└── index.html *
